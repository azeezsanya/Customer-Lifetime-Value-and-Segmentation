Customer LTV Prediction and Customer Segmentation

**Why should companies care about the lifetime values of their customers?**


It's now a known fact that the power of effective Data Science and Analytics has been felt by almost all the business industries with the retail sector been in the front. The competition within the retail; industry or e-commerce is growing every day and if a company wants to remain relevant in this industry using data to capture its customers is one of the things to consider. Leveraging the power of data with the aim of using the insights to entice and retain customers as well as generating profits is very important for the survival of every company.

Retail companies use key metrics like total amount spent, average order, how often they order, conversion rate and other important metrics to measure the lifetime of their customers. These metrics can also be used to segment customers for marking purposes like discount or offers to the appropriate customers. These measurements provided general insight into the behavioral tendencies of customers. Understanding your customers is very important and it could give you a significant edge over your competitors.

Customer intelligence (CI) is the process of gathering and analyzing information regarding customers, their details and activities, to create efficient and more effective customer relationships as well as improve decision-making by retail organizations. In a nutshell, for big retail players all over the world, data analytics is applied more these days at all stages of the retail process â€“ taking track of popular products that are emerging, doing forecasts of sales and future demand via predictive simulation, optimizing placements of products and offers through heat-mapping of customers and many others.
